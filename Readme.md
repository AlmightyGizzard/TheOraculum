# The Oraculum
## A third year project about procedurally generating lore
This is the Oraculum, a very simple game (by design) created to facilitate my university third year project, which revolved around the procedural generation of background lore and worldbuilding. 

The game utilises a top down perspective and a few fancy vision shaders to allow for certain objects to only be visible to the player when they are in direct line of sight, hopefully to create a more claustrophobic experience, especially as the lights begin to turn off, forcing the player to rush back to safety before the darkness claims them. 

Of course, the game is only meant to house the main element - the player will come across various 'pages' that each describe the lives of various *Archivists* that lived and worked in the library the game is set in. The game randomly generates the history of these Archivists, hopefully generating intrigue from the player along with it, similar to games like *Dwarf Fortress* or *Caves of Qud*. 

Because the nature of my project was to compare this system to a more traditionally handwritten narrative, the game also sometimes uses a set of handwritten Archivist pages rather than generating a set procedurally. This means that the player only experiences the most interesting part of this game 50% of the time - now that the project has ended I plan to patch this with an option to switch between the two systems at the main menu.
